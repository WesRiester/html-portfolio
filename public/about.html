<h1>My Name is Wesley...</h1>
<p>I was a sound mixer at a for profit school called Full Sail University. 
  However, after graduating and moving to Georgia to attempt getting into the film industry, 
  I came to the realization that I really didnt want that life. I ended up waiting tables at an IHOP
  and hating it. It seemed there just wasnt much work for a niche department like sound.</p>

<p>I maintained my work at IHOP until everything changed. 
  Covid-19 happened and like many people I saw it as an opportunity for change. I left IHOP and began trying new things.
  Delivery driving, Spa management, and even light merchandising. Unfortunately, none of them really helped me feel like I was 
  getting anywhere. I was still unfullfilled. 
</p>

<p>Then I came across the idea of learning tech skills. I took an online course in cybersecurity,
  but that really didnt feel right. Then I found web developement. It was still tech, still interesting, and much more on the creative side. 
  I felt excited again. I was learning and eating it all up. I bought books, courses, practice apps, all sorts of stuff. This finally felt like something fullfilling.
  And that brings us to today, where I am slowly but surely gaining skills and becoming a web developer.
  So just keep your eyes peeled. Be on the lookout for me.
  Im just getting started.
